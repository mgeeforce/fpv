Playing with Hexo. This is my first post to [FPV.ADEPTUS.IO](http://fpv.adeptus.io). Here are a couple images of the blunt section I recently cut using a DIY hot wire cutter. EPP does not cut as easily as blue styrofoam - I found that more heat would have made the cutting smoother but it worked out pretty well in the end. I was using piano wire as my filament. I had previously tried some very high gauge nichrome wire but it kept breaking so went with something thicker.

This is just a dry fit.
